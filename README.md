roguepi_tft
===========

This is a set of python files to to use an Adafruit PiTFT - 2.8" Touchscreen Display for Raspberry Pi to create a pen testing drop box

I've created a python script that will fill a sceen with 
IP Address
Default Gateway (Success / Failure Ping)
Pinging Google (Success / Failure)
Secure Tunnel Conenction # Using log-me-in hamachi at the moment but may switch to home SSH/VPN tunnel
Number of Hosts on network #In the works (Nmap on boot output host number to file?)

To be done. Python script on boot to enable PiTFT buttons to do the following
Launch ip_add.py
Launch NMAP and display hosts?
Screen on/off?
Power pi on/off?

Also have touch screen capabilities. Hopefully can create a menu to choose pentesting tools and launch via on screen menu and buttons.
